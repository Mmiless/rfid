This should be the correct link, even though it says lab 2.  Github classroom makes a new repository for each new lab which contains all the labs for this class, so I'm just keeping everything for this class in the lab 2 repository and using the folders for individual labs.

Questions:

1) 
URL: /mailbox?password=123
I notice that my password is passed through the query string in the URL.

2) 
person has the type dictionary, while person_json has the type string.  

3) 
Removing 'sort_keys = True' stops the data from being alphabetically sorted.

4) 
Often times, RESTful APIs cost money or require some sort of account.  The API key is used so that the server can tell who is requesting the data, and deny their request if appropriate.
